# RandomWords

This is a fun little script that can take any text string and prints 5 random words from the string to the command line. The delimiter I am using is the newline (\n) regular expression due to the format of the document I am using, This can be modified, for instance you can use ' ' as a delimiter which will print all text between spaces as a word.
